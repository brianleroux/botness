## Bots aren't super new
```
But this manifestation is. These Bots are not here just to chat. 

      🐧  "This Bot is a superagent acting on your behalf 
          and it better for some things than using an App"

      🐮  "Similar to web tech a Bot can exist simultaneously 
          across different platforms and adapt seamlessly through 
          contexts they are in. The interfaces is conversation 
          and the conversation can move between platforms 
          transparently."

      🐧  "Right!"

      🐮  "👊🏾"

## 💰 function pricing
- 🙉 **AWS** `First 1 million requests per month are free. $0.20 per 1 million requests thereafter ($0.0000002 per request)`
- 🙊 **Google** `pricing remains unannounced`
- 🙈 **Azure** `Function requests are charged per million requests, with the first 1 million requests free. [Then ambigous] pay for what you use with compute metered to the nearest 100ms at Per/GB` 
```





















                                       I find Azure pricing nebulous and confusing. Maybe thats just me.

# For Begin we chose AWS Lambda
```
However, I believe any of these solutions is a fine choice. 

- The lockin risk at the function level is trivial to avoid
- Vendors increasing exponentially while compute continues to get cheaper
- Accelerant (time to deploy and ease of maintenance)
- AWS services surrounding Lambda are amazing and by far industry leading

# 💸 The real cost 
<blockquote>
"Lisp programmers know the value of everything and the cost of nothing."
- Alan Perlis ripping off Oscar Wilde
</blockquote>
```
The real price you'll pay is the cost of a adopting a new microservice style architecture.

👉 A new way of thinking for your dev team
👉 Also the tools for container techniques are still new(ish) and often raw
👉 Many repos that produce even smaller deployment artifacts makes dep mgmt tricky
👉 Many repos can also make deployment tricky (to mitigate automate everything from day zero)





















(Truly it is cheap enough to experiment with all them and I totally reccomend you do.)

### Things to maybe think about

- Bots are freaky web servers 😈
- But you don't have to build the server part anymore (⁉️)
